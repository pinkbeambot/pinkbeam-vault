# TASK-006: Build Services Pages

## 🎯 Objective
Create detailed service pages for each consulting offering (Digital Transformation, AI Strategy, Process Automation, Technology Architecture, Growth Strategy) with comprehensive information, use cases, and clear next steps for prospects.

## 📖 Context
After visitors land on the homepage, they need detailed pages explaining each service in depth. These pages serve as conversion funnels and SEO landing pages for specific service searches. Each page should answer: What is it? Who needs it? What do you get? What's the process? What's the investment?
