# TASK-007: Build Engagement Models Pages

## 🎯 Objective
Create comprehensive pages for each engagement model (Workshops, Assessments, Retainers, Projects) explaining how clients work with Pink Beam, what's included, pricing structure, and how to get started.

## 📖 Context
Prospects need to understand HOW they can work with us, not just WHAT we do. Each engagement model page should clarify the format, duration, deliverables, investment, and ideal use cases to help prospects self-qualify and choose the right engagement type.
