# TASK-003: Pricing Page with Tiers

## 🎯 Objective
Create a comprehensive, transparent pricing page that displays all service tiers clearly, enables easy comparison, and drives conversions through clear CTAs.

**Pricing Categories:**
1. **Web Design Packages** — One-time project pricing
2. **SEO Retainers** — Monthly service pricing
3. **Maintenance Plans** — Monthly care plans

**Wait for:**
- [[TASK-001]] — Landing page (consistent design patterns)
