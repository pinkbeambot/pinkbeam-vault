# TASK-002: Services Pages (Web Design, SEO, Maintenance)

## 🎯 Objective
Create dedicated, detailed service pages for each of Pink Beam Web's three core offerings: Web Design, SEO Services, and Maintenance Plans.

## 📖 Context
Each service needs its own comprehensive page that educates potential clients, addresses their pain points, showcases relevant work, and drives conversions. These pages will be linked from the landing page and navigation.

**Service Pages:**
1. **Web Design** — Custom website design and development
2. **SEO Services** — Search engine optimization and content strategy
3. **Maintenance** — Ongoing website care and support

**Wait for:**
- [[TASK-001]] — Landing page (for consistent design patterns)
