# TASK-001: Landing Page Design & Build (UI-only)

## 🎯 Objective
Design and build a visually stunning, high-converting landing page for Pink Beam Web that establishes credibility, showcases services, and drives quote requests.

## 📖 Context
The landing page is the primary entry point for potential clients. It needs to communicate our value proposition clearly, build trust, and guide visitors toward requesting a quote. This is UI-only - no backend integration yet.

**Key Elements:**
- Hero section with compelling headline and CTA
- Social proof (client logos, testimonials)
- Service overview cards
- Portfolio showcase (static for now)
- Pricing teaser
- FAQ section
- Contact/Quote CTA section

**Wait for:** None - this is a foundation task
