### Section Headline
## You're Doing Work You Shouldn't Be Doing

Most founders spend 60% of their time on tasks that don't move the needle. Here's what's actually eating your days:

---

### Pain Point Card 1: The Research Black Hole
**Headline:** Drowning in Information

You're supposed to make strategic decisions, but you're stuck reading 47-page market reports, hunting through competitor pricing, and manually tracking industry news. By the time you've finished researching, the opportunity's gone.

---

### Pain Point Card 2: The Sales Time Sink
**Headline:** Sales Outreach That Never Ends

You know you should be prospecting, but crafting 50 personalized emails takes 4 hours you don't have. So you push it off. And your pipeline dries up. Again.

---

### Pain Point Card 3: The Support Trap
**Headline:** Tickets That Multiply Overnight

Every morning starts with 30+ support requests. Password resets, feature questions, refund requests. You're paying yourself founder salary to do $15/hour work.

---

## Section 3: Solution Overview

### Tone/Voice Notes
- Shift from pain to possibility
- Introduce the "employee" concept as the core mental model
- Make it feel like hiring, not buying software

---

### Testimonial 1
> "We hired Sarah the Researcher and Mike the SDR three months ago. Since then, Mike has booked 47 qualified demos and Sarah's weekly briefs have shaped our entire Q1 strategy. We're literally running on AI employees now."

**— David Chen, CEO at Nexus AI**

---

## Section 9: FAQ

### Tone/Voice Notes
- Answer the real objections
- Be honest, not defensive
- Use this section to handle pricing, data, and differentiation concerns

---

### FAQ Item 1
**Q: How is this different from other AI tools?**

A: Most AI tools are interfaces—you still have to prompt them, wait for output, and integrate the results. Pink Beam employees are autonomous. You configure them once, and they work independently: monitoring, researching, creating, and responding without constant input. Think employee, not tool.

---

### FAQ Item 2
**Q: How do I configure an employee?**

A: Setup takes about 5 minutes. You connect your existing tools (CRM, help desk, social accounts), define your brand voice and priorities, and set any guardrails. Your employee starts working immediately and learns from your feedback over time.

---

### FAQ Item 3
**Q: What integrations do you support?**

A: We integrate with 100+ tools including Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, Intercom, Slack, Notion, Google Workspace, LinkedIn, Twitter, Meta Ads, and more. New integrations ship weekly. If we don't support something you need, we'll build it.

---

### FAQ Item 4
**Q: Is my data secure?**

A: Yes. We're SOC 2 Type II certified, use AES-256 encryption, and operate under a strict zero data retention policy—your proprietary information is never used to train our models. We sign NDAs with enterprise customers and can deploy in isolated environments if needed.

---

### FAQ Item 5
**Q: Can I customize the employee's voice and approach?**

A: Absolutely. During setup, you define tone (professional, casual, technical), communication style, and brand guidelines. You can update these anytime, and your employee adapts. Many customers train different employees for different contexts—one for enterprise prospects, another for startup founders.

---

### FAQ Item 6
**Q: What happens if something goes wrong?**

A: Every employee has human-in-the-loop checkpoints for critical actions. They escalate uncertain situations with full context. Plus, you get complete visibility into everything they do—every email sent, every ticket handled, every report generated. You're always in control.

---

### FAQ Item 7
**Q: How much does it cost?**

A: Individual employees start at $500/month. Full teams start at $1,500/month. Compare that to $6K-12K/month for a human hire—plus benefits, onboarding, and management overhead. Annual plans include two months free.

---

### FAQ Item 8
**Q: Can I cancel anytime?**

A: Yes. Monthly plans can be canceled anytime with 7 days notice. Annual plans can be downgraded to monthly at renewal. No long-term contracts, no hidden fees. We win by delivering value, not locking you in.

---

### FAQ Item 9
**Q: How many employees can I hire?**

A: As many as you need. Start with one. Scale to twenty. Most customers begin with their biggest pain point—usually research or sales—and expand from there once they see the ROI.

---

### FAQ Item 10
**Q: Can I talk to someone before signing up?**

A: Of course. Book a demo and we'll show you exactly how AI employees work for your specific use case. No sales pressure—just a walkthrough and honest answers to your questions.
