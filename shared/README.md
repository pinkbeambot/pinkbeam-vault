## Design Principles

All Pink Beam services share:

1. **Same color palette** - Pink beam on void black
2. **Same typography** - Space Grotesk, Inter, JetBrains Mono
3. **Same component library** - shadcn/ui with custom theming
4. **Same animation style** - Framer Motion, purposeful motion
5. **Different navigation** - Service-specific navbars and layouts

## Service Differentiation

While sharing the design system, each service maintains its own identity through:

- **Service-specific navigation** - Tailored to the service's needs
- **Service-specific hero sections** - Different value propositions
- **Service-specific dashboards** - Different functionality
- **Service-specific CTAs** - Different conversion goals

The goal is to feel like distinct products that happen to share a parent company, not like different sections of the same product.
